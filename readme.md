## Introduction
This project is a terminal-based sorting algorithm visualizer written in C++. It displays the sorting process step by step in the terminal, allowing users to observe how different sorting algorithms work in real-time.

## Features
- Visualizes sorting algorithms in a terminal environment.
- Supports multiple popular sorting algorithms.
- Step-by-step execution to show how the array is modified.
- Size of array can be determined by the terminal size
- User can add custom delay between execution steps

## Supported Algorithms
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Alternate Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

## Installation
1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedAmrNabil/TerminalSortingVisualiser.git
cd TerminalSortingVisualiser
```
2. Compile using make
```bash
make compile
```
3. Run from the bin directory
```bash
./bin/main
```

## Usage
Once the program is running, follow the on-screen prompts to select a sorting algorithm and specify the delay between each sorting step. The visualizer will show the progress of the sort in real-time using symbols to represent array values.
